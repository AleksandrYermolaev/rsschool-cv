## About me
I am from Donetsk. I have been working in the field of fire safety for the last 6 years. I have been wanting to study programming and development for more than a year, but I have always lacked motivation. After hearing about the RS School courses and getting a lot of positive feedback, I just got excited about it. I have an analytical mindset, and my professional activity has developed in me the skills of attention to detail and exactingness to myself. I hope these qualities will help me achieve my goals.
